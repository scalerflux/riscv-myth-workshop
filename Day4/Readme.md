## Branch logic & test bench (sum of 1 to 9)

A conditional branch instruction will branch to a target PC if its condition is true. Conditions are a comparison of the two source register values. Implementing conditional branch instructions will require:

* Determining whether the instruction is a branch that is taken ($taken_br).
* Computing the branch target ($br_tgt_pc).
*  Updating the PC ($pc) accordingly.

Let’s start with the branch condition ($taken_br). Each conditional branch instruction has a different condition expression based on the two source register values ($src1_value and $src2_value
