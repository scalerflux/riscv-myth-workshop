## Introduction

### TL-Verilog
TL-Verilog (Transaction-Level Verilog) is an extension of SystemVerilog that simplifies hardware design by introducing higher-level abstractions. Key features:
- **Pipelines as first-class constructs** - Define pipeline stages with simple syntax (`|pipe`)
- **Implicit timing** - No need to manually manage clock signals in most cases  
- **Reduced code** - Typically 3-5x less code compared to traditional Verilog
- **Validity** - Built-in support for valid signals to reduce switching activity

### Makerchip IDE
[Makerchip](https://makerchip.com/) is a free, browser-based IDE for TL-Verilog development:
- Real-time compilation and simulation
- Integrated waveform viewer
- Visual diagram of your design
- No installation required
